            <h2 class="center-text">Data Collection Monitoring Tool Guide</h2>
            <p>This tool helps users monitor trials for their Minimum Viable Products (MVPs). It guides users through a series of steps to crosscheck submissions and track progress in near real-time. Additionally, it facilitates seamless communication with relevant extension agents in the field.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="define-the-trial-conditions" class="section level3">
            <h3>I. Define the trial conditions</h3>
            <p>On the left-side panel of the tool, the user is initially provided with a set of options to define the trial conditions.</p>

            <div id="define-the-filter-options" class="section level4">
                <h4>Define the Stage</h4>
                <p>The user will need to select the stage for which the data is being collected. This could be the validation, piloting, or NOT trials.</p>

                <h4>Define the Experiment</h4>
                <p>The user will need to select the trial experiment.</p>

                <h4>Define the Date</h4>
                <p>The user will need to specify the trial period for which to monitor the submissions. The default period initially selected is the earliest date of submission and the current date. These vary for different use cases.</p>

                <h4>Select the Enumerator</h4>
                <p>This filter provides a list of all enumerators' identification numbers registered for the trial, in ascending order. The initial selection shows details for all the enumerators. The user can select specific enumerators to view their progress. Multiple selections are allowed in this case.</p>

                <h4>Select the Household</h4>
